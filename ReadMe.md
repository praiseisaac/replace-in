# Replace in

I decided to play around with Rust lang and worked on this.
This allows you to set an action to replace any occurrence of a string in a file or folder.

### Prequisite
1. Rust programming language. Install [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. MacOS.

### Getting started
1. To get started, run `git clone `.
2. Run `./start` from the directory. If you get a `permission denied error`, run `chmod 755 ./start`, and rerun the file.
3. Move the `replace_in` workflow to the `~/Library/Services` folder on your mac.

### Verify
1. If you don't see the `Replace in` option in the `Quick action` menu, click `Customize` and check the `Replace in` checkbox.
