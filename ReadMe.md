# Replace in (MacOS only)

I decided to play around with Rust lang and worked on this.
This allows you to replace any occurrence of a text in a file or directory.

### Prequisite
1. Rust programming language. Install [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. MacOS.

### Getting started
1. To get started, run `git clone https://github.com/praiseisaac/replace-in.git`.
2. Run `cd replace-in && ./start` from the directory. 
3. If you get a `permission denied error`, run `chmod 755 ./start` to give the file execute permission. You can read the file to verify its contents. Next, run `./start`.

### Running
1. To run the application, right click on a file or directory you want to replace a text in, navigate to `Quick actions`, then click on the `Replace in` action.
2. If you don't see the `Replace in` option in the `Quick action` menu, click `Customize`, then check the `Replace in` checkbox.
3. Repeat step 1.
