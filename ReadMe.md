### Replace in

I decided to play around with Rust lang and worked on this.
This allows you to set an action to replace any occurrence of a string in a file or folder.

# Prequisite
1. Rust programming language. Install [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. MacOS.

# Getting started
1. To get started, run `cargo run` from the root directory.
2. Move the `replace_in` workflow to the `~/Library/Services` folder on your mac.
3. Check to see if it shows up in the `Quick actions` menu.
